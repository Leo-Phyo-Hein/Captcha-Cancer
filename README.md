# What is Captcha Cancer?
A Chromium extension that spams the user with captchas and ads.

## Inspiration
Our team wanted to build something that would interfere with productivity and make a mess out of someone's lovely computer. We started brainstorming and realised... Almost everyone has Adblock installed on their computers to eliminate those myriad ads which clutter screens to death.

So... why not play the UNO reverse card and make an _Adblock'nt_?

## What it does
Captcha Cancer is a _harmless_ browser extension made for Chromium browsers. It spawns **BIG RED CAPTCHAS (TM)** that you need to solve under 10 seconds. "Or else what?" you may ask. It's simple - your active page gets bukkake'd with sketchy advertisements from god-knows-where. Oh, and those inactive pages you left unattended for a minute? Tab back in and you'll be greeted by **BIG RED CAPTCHAS (TM)**. And more ads than ex-es you've ever had.

## How we built it
While greatly tempted by the siren song of ChatGPT, we built the extension from scratch ourselves after  going through [Google's Extension 101  tutorials](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/extensions-101/). The project was built mainly with JavaScript, but involved aspects of Html and CSS as well.

## Challenges we ran into
- None of us have ever built a browser extension before.
- None of us have ever used JavaScript before.
- None of us could understand the error messages in the browser.

## What's next for Captcha Cancer
World domination.
